# Data science team prestige of the two weeks womentechsters bootcamp

We learnt the basics of excel and powerbi and were asked to select a project that is in line with atleast one of the SDGs to implement on power bi.

We eventually went with an overall ticket analysis dashboard

This dashbord was in line with SDG 9 and 12
SDG 12- "Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns"
SDG 9- "industry, innovation and infrastructure"

Our dashboard analyses the number of tickets issued after a selected "start of care" (SOC) date.

it can be used in SDG goal 12 to ensure consumption and production patterns are sustainable;
take this scenairio,
A modifaction was made to a product, the date of that modification is our SOC date, if the tickets (which can be sales) increases or drops drastically we can make appropriate adjustment based on what the dashboard is showing to ensure the production is matching up to the consumption patterns.
In the fashion industry this can be used for analysis of new clothing lines.

In the same vein,
to ensure the right innovation, idustry and infastructure are put in place as in goal 9 this dashboard can be used.

Note: this project can easily be used to reinforce earlier powerbi classes, the data sets used are attached.
this project was also sourced from youtube and modified to suite SDG goals.
